    <p><i>The spread of Buddhism demonstrated the appeal of certain religions to people of lower classes, and its widespread influence in East Asia but limited influence outside of it shows how certain religions spread, adapting to and influencing different civilizations. The teachings of Buddhism appealed to people of lower classes, especially merchants because it did not have a hierarchy built into the religion. For example, unlike Hinduism, Buddhism preached a universal message that anyone could achieve enlightenment by following the eightfold path, which appealed to merchants, who were often in the lower classes of society with a reputation for being dishonest and money-oriented. Since merchants were the people doing the most traveling during the era of the Silk Road, they were the primary reason for Buddhism’s widespread influence. As merchants accumulated wealth from the Silk Road trade, some chose to build monasteries with the hope of honoring their religions, which attracted other Buddhist practitioners and eventually grew into cities. However, translated Buddhist texts, specifically those translated into the Chinese language, played an instrumental role in Buddhism’s dominance in East Asia. The Kaibao Canon was one of the first Buddhist texts translated into Mandarin, and it spread to Korea and Japan, whose citizens were educated in Chinese literature. With the widespread printing and trade of Buddhist texts, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and numerous other countries adapted Buddhism to their existing cultures, which continue to this day. One form of Buddhism that became prominent in East Asia was Mahayana Buddhism, which deified the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, as shown by Greek and Roman-inspired statues of them. As Buddhism mixed with preexisting belief systems, distinct forms of worship emerged. The minimalistic life that Buddha preached eventually gave way as wealthy monasteries arose, becoming an example of the materialism Buddha preached against. Buddhism combined the Shinto religion in Japan, changing the religion into something new. However influential Buddhism was in East Asia, its spread was limited beyond the region. Nomadic people had no written language, rendering the numerous translated Buddhist Chinese texts obsolete. This, combined with the influence of religions such as Zoroastrianism and Islam, further hindered Buddhism’s spread beyond East Asia. The spread of it through merchants and printed texts show how culture was able to move along the Silk Road, and how it was not as successful in Central Asia and Europe but continued to influence East Asia. The Journey to the West, a novel written after the Silk Road ended, is a reference to the superiority of Buddhism, and the numerous Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are displayed as divine beings with magical powers. Whether true to its original form or not, the appeal of Buddhism was felt by many in East Asia and the changes it underwent as it was adapted to different cultures demonstrate how certain religions resonate with people of a certain group.
