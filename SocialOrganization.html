    <p><i>Silk represented a continuation of governments' means to distinguish themselves from civilians by showing their status, power, and wealth. Silk was an extremely desired commodity in China and the rest of Eurasia. The high demand for silk was draining the Roman economy, with dissent ranging from its price to its cultural impact. Politicians such as Seneca the Younger complained about revealing silk garments, lamenting that “materials that do not hide the body, nor even one's decency, can be called clothes.” The Romans subsequently had to ban silk, but the association of silk with high status and the elite class was not unique to it. One of the continuities of world history is leaders using different means to legitimize their control. It may be through divinity or ostentatious displays of wealth such as building public monuments or showing off their riches through other means. The Olmec heads in Mesoamerica, the Great Pyramids in Egypt, and the terracotta soldiers in China demonstrated the wealth and power of the respective monarchies. Wealth has always been associated with governance, and therefore power, and provided the means leaders distinguished themselves from lower class people. In China, silk production was in the hands of peasants. Despite the high demand, many Chinese families remained in poverty, producing silk they could not afford for the elite. This process was done by Chinese women, but the commerce was controlled by men, reinforcing pre-existing gender imbalances, which reflected in a popular Chinese story called "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl", in which a celestial weaver for the Queen Mother of Heaven is still subject to the jurisdiction of her mortal husband. This represented continuities in the social organization of China, in which society was highly patriarchal and Confucian values were omnipresent. The tribute system in China, in which foreign countries would exchange gifts with China and recognize China as the superior nation, showed how silk maintained a delicate power dynamic between nations. On the other hand, the Chinese government also gave large amounts of silk to nomadic people to appease them and keep them from invading their empire. This is another way that silk reinforced and maintained the status quo both within and between nations. This was shown by the Xiongnu raids on the Han dynasty, which only stopped after the Han government sent them large amounts of silk and other luxury goods. Even as the silk secret was leaked in 700 CE, silk remained a symbol of wealth and power. Governments across Eurasia, such as the Byzantine empire, saw silk as a symbol of high status and passed laws restricting its wear to the elite. This represents a continuation of the motivation behind massive sculptures and public monuments--the elite were flaunting their wealth and status to peasants, no different from earlier civilizations. Silk provided another means by which rulers could show their power, and it reinforced social organization by distinguishing the rich from the poor and the powerful from the peasant.
