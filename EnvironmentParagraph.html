    <p><i>The trade facilitated by the Silk Road showed different cultures each playing a crucial role in the trade network, demonstrating how biome affects the innovations and resources people adapt to. During the Agricultural Revolution, although each civilization began to switch from hunter-gathering to agriculture at roughly the same time relative to human history, the resources available to them in their regions determined how quickly, to what extent, and how successfully they made the switch. This is why Mesopotamia was the most successful civilization of its time: its location between two rivers combined with the abundance of edible plants and natural resources was purely by chance, and helped them become the most advanced civilization of the time. Likewise, on the Silk Road, civilizations that had an abundance of natural resources, such as fertile land for growing crops and waterways for transportation and irrigation, would be agricultural-based. The trend of civilizations growing around resources would be demonstrated later by the founding cities near an oasis where vegetation was available; the city of Merv, founded on an oasis, grew to be one of the most prominent citifies of the Silk Road. These agricultural civilizations tended to have higher populations, be more densely populated, especially along rivers, and have more specialization in occupations. China and Rome were the most developed and populous civilizations of their time, and both were of the temperate broadleaf forest biome. Surpluses of food were not as commonplace in hunter-gatherer societies, but in agricultural societies they allowed people to specialize more in their respective trades; if agriculture was more efficient, people could devote their energy elsewhere. Thus, higher populations correlated to more innovations and manufactured goods. In Rome, one could be a politician, a glassmaker, or a banker, and in China, one could be a scholar, a silk weaver, or a farmer, just to name a few. There were not as many options for nomadic people on the steppe, which resulted in a less structured society overall. There was a more egalitarian society between genders and classes, as men and women shared similar duties, but it limited the number of innovations the society could make. These differences were utilized by the Silk Road. As the trade networks grew to stretch across Central Asia, nomadic people were crucial in ensuring the transmittance of goods. While larger, more populous empires would produce goods, the nomadic people of the steppe, with their expertise in the land and animals, would carry them to and from cities. They would spread innovations and culture while other civilizations cultivated it. The Mongol Empire, formed from the unification of the people of the steppe, took this further, and their vast empire made it possible for goods to travel safely from India to Europe. Even though the Mongols practices no trades of their own, their knowledge of the steppe, horseback riding, and warfare–the very survival skills that helped them on the steppe–were now being used to unite Eurasia under one empire and integrate countless different cultures, for better or worse. The differences in biome along the Silk Road affected the way civilizations developed, but each civilization played an important role and had a purpose.  </i>
